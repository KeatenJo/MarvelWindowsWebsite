# MarvelWindowsWebsite
A website made for Marvel Windows and Services.

Braden, Mason. In order for you to see your website, you need to click on the clone/download green button at the top right.  In the window click on downlaod as zip.

You will need an archive opening software for opening the zipped files. 
	- 7zip
	- Winrar
	- Both are free, 7zip should be installed on your computer as default if you have a newer computer.  If not go with that one.

# You will only be able to see your website right now on your computer.
	Once you download your files open the zipped file and extract the files to some folder of your choosing.
	Open the file called src
	Click on index.html and it should load up in your web browser ie, chrome, firefox, safari etc. 
	From there once other pages are added you will be able to navigate it just like an actual website. 

# I also have a file for you guys to add information to
	That file is called thingsIneed.txt.
	There are a few things I'll need you two to come up with for your website.  This will more than likely be text and information about you and your company, that you'll want on your website.  
	I'll update that as needed.  

	You can just email me your text when you get a chance and I'll update the file.


# Final Thought: 
	We are currently in prototype mode.
	Everything being made can be changed by you guys.  If you don't like the way something looks let me know and I'll fix it.  
	Right now pages are mostly stylized and I will continue to style them.
	If something doesn't look styled, then I'm in the process of doing it.  

#Alright Thats it Thanks you Guys for this Oppertunity
